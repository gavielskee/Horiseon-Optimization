# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description 

In this assignment, I modified the already existing code in order to meet accessibility standards. I did this by replacing a portion of elements with the necessary tags like 'header' or 'footer'. In doing so, I had to change parts of CSS to correlate to the new elements that I had created. Furthermore, I had made sure that the images in the html file had 'alt' attributes attached to them. To top things off, I went through the code again and cleaned up what I deemed to be unnecessary. I took part in this assignment in order to gain more understanding in meeting the accessibility needs of a website and what should be done in order to meet those standards.
